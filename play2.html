    <p class="speech">Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
     To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
     Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
     Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
     Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
     My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
     But, though thou art adjudged to the death
     And passed sentence may not be recall'd
     But to our honour's great disparagement,
     Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
     Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
     To seek thy life by beneficial help:
     Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
     Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
     And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
     Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</p>

     <p class="speech">I will, my lord.</p>

     <p class="speech">Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
     But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</p>
